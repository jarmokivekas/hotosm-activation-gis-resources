**Text search** is a free-form keyword search for projects

**Country** in which the project area is situated in. Autocomplete missin. Specific spelling here https://tasking-manager-tm4-production-api.hotosm.org/api/v2/countries/

**Interests** shall be one of the interested parties listed in  https://tasking-manager-tm4-production-api.hotosm.org/api/v2/interests/

## Sort orders

Currently uses the Tasking manager default sorting order which is based on the urgency

### By project ID

Ordering by project ID is very useful for creating tables for Wikis of spreadsheets that are consistent over the time of the activation. Project ID's are a sequential increasing number. This means sorting by project ID will sort the project in order of creation. Over the span of weeks or months during the activation, this order will stay the same which makes it a good default order to use in activation documentation as it will prevent projects moving up and down in the table over time. 

## Planned features


### Pending Archival filter 

Projects matching the "Pending archival" filter are:

- Over 99% mapped
- Over 99% validated
- Have the `PUBLISHED` status

These projects need attention from activation management to be brought all the way to completion, and eventually set to the `ARCHIVED` status. 

### Pending Validation filter

Project mathing the "Pending Validation" filter are:

- over 99% mapped
- less than 99% validated
- have the `PUBLISHED` status

These projects can be brought to the attention of validation teams by the activation management
